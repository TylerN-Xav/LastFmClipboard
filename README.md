# LastFmClipboard
An application that connects with your Last.fm account and copies the song you are listening to or last listened to, to your clipboard so you can easily share it.

For clarification, this is my first project where I learn how to utilize API and learn GUI using Electron, so expect non-optimal programming or unpolished features and bugs.
